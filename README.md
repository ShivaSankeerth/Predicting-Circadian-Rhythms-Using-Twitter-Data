# Abstract

Circadian rhythm helps to guide our body to let it know when to sleep and when to wake up. Itâ€™s crucial in helping us regain energy lost from being awake and performing daily activities. Hence better understanding of circadian cycle would help us to maintain energy levels. We are trying to predict the sleep patterns and which features play a significant role in affecting the circadian cycles based mainly on twitter data.

# Introduction

The goal is to perform analysis on the sleep patterns of the different categories of people. We will use different features like Job Title, Timezone, Seasons and perform analysis on why the sleep patterns are differing w.r.t to those features. At the end, a classification model to predict which users falls under which category of the sleep pattern was implemented. For this progress report, we analyzed 80 Million rows of data which is further fused with other important relevant columns. For extracting latitude, longitude, we used an external API called Geopy. For extracting weather information of a particular place at a particular time, we used the World Weather Online API.
